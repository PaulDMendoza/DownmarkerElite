Bugs
----

 * Browser control keyboard shortcuts should be suppressed. For example, when the browser control has focus, ctrl+N opens a new Internet Explorer window instead of creating a new document.

Features
--------

 * stylesheet support
 * search tool in toolstrip
 * status bar should show some feedback when saving with ctrl+s
 * "about document": description, version information, recently opened documents. 
 * automatically write title when opening empty document
 * link editor form: suggest other markdown documents in link dropdown
 * save splitter state
 * open button
 * save window position and size
 * prettier back/forward arrows

Future
------
 * detect file changes on disk and reload automatically (prompt for conflicts)
 * gtk# webkit# version for mono/linux
 * deb package for ubuntu
 * sync editor/html scrollbars. Currently the html preview always jumps to the start.
 * context menu for links to .md files: open in new tab
 * show link in status bar on hover
 * export to html from file menu and command line
 * Configurable text editor (launch in response to edit command)
 * link editor file:/// URL completion (both absolute and relative)
