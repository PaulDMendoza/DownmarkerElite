DownMarker is a wiki-style viewer and editor for text files containing [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). 

There is still stuff on the [todo list](notes/todo.md).

This project was originally pulled from BitBucket to this GitHub account. The original project was not written by me. I have just added a few small features to this.
